They cherished the juices of their kind that helped bring tranquility to the world known as the Essence of Tomay which had the power to cure disease and prolong life to those who knew how to harness it.
                    As one of the few remaining survivors of his kind, is it up to Tomate to write the final chapter of his people. Restore the honor once bestowed upon the Tomatians, bringing an end to a once prosperous era in the World of Ediblon.</p>

During the war, he married his wife, Madre, who had died while giving birth to their son Tomate.

                <p class="card-text">Little is known about the Carrote people. Whether they were mutants before the war or simply shapeshifters who preyed on the weak, their existence remains a mystery.
                    Tomate was aware of the mystery of the Carrote, but he needed to find out what had happened to Sheriff, a Cucumberton who had been lost after trying to find the source of the missing tomay. Tomate had a keen sense for trickery and deceit and knew Carrot Barman could not be trusted. It was a vain attempt in asking the Carrote where Sheriff had gone, as Carrot Barman shows no empathy towards Tomate's questioning.
